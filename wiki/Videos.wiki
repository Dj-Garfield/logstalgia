#summary Creating videos with Logstalgia.

== Recording Videos ==

=== Linux / Mac Users ===

You can create a video of Logstalgia using the --output-ppm-stream option. This creates an uncompressed sequence of screenshots in PPM format which can then be processed by another program (such as `ffmpeg`) to produce a video. The below command line will create a video at 60fps in x264 format (assumes you have ffmpeg with x264 support):

{{{
logstalgia --output-ppm-stream - | ffmpeg -y -b 3000K -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libx264 logstalgia.mp4
}}}

You can also adjust the output frame rate with `--output-framerate`. Note you will need to adjust the frame rate used by the encoder (eg `ffmpeg -r`) as well.

*Note*: You may need to add '-vpre default' to the ffmpeg command. The exact arguments to ffmpeg may vary depending on the version you have. There is a good guide to using x264 with ffmpeg [http://rob.opendot.cl/index.php/useful-stuff/ffmpeg-x264-encoding-guide/ here].

=== Windows Users ===

On Windows I'd strongly recommend [http://www.fraps.com Fraps]. Fraps works with any program that uses OpenGL or Direct3D and is really really fast (you can capture Logstalgia at 60fps with no slow down).

If you still want to use the built in support:

{{{
logstalgia --output-ppm-stream ppm.out
ffmpeg -y -b 3000K -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i ppm.out -vcodec libx264 logstalgia.x264.avi
}}}

Afterward you will want to delete the rather large file `ppm.out` containing the uncompressed video data.

You can get `ffmpeg` for windows [http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/ here].
