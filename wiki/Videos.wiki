#summary Creating videos with Logstalgia.

== Recording Videos ==

=== General ===

You can create a video of Logstalgia using the `--output-ppm-stream` option. This creates an uncompressed sequence of screenshots in PPM format which can then be processed a video encoder (such as ffmpeg) to produce a video.

You can also adjust the output frame rate with `--output-framerate`. Note you will need to adjust the frame rate used by the encoder (eg ffmpeg -r) to match, unless you are going for a speed-up timelapse or slow motion effect.

Make sure you keep the window of Logstalgia entirely visible while recording. If you minimize or partially obscure the window, your video card may decide not draw the output consistently and you will get artifacts in your recording. You may like to use the `-f` option to run in full-screen mode to stop this happening.

You may want to record your video in widescreen as that is the trend for online video now days. You can record in 720p by adding -1280x720 to the command line. 

=== Linux / Mac Users ===

The below command line will create a video at 60fps in x264 format (assumes you have recent version of ffmpeg with x264 support): 

{{{
logstalgia --output-ppm-stream - |  ffmpeg -y -b 3000K -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i - -vcodec libx264 -vpre slow -threads 0 logstalgia.mp4
}}}

*Note*: ffmpeg seems to be a constantly moving target, so you may find you need slightly different arguments with your version. You may need to change '-vpre medium' to '-fpre /path/to/libx264-blah.ffpreset', for instance. There is a good guide to using x264 with ffmpeg [http://rob.opendot.cl/index.php/useful-stuff/ffmpeg-x264-encoding-guide/ here]. 

=== Windows Users ===

On Windows if you aren't too fussed about the precision of the output, you might want to try a direct video capture program like [http://www.fraps.com Fraps]. Fraps works with any program that uses OpenGL or Direct3D and is pretty fast (you can capture Logstalgia at 60fps with no slow down in many cases).

If you don't want to use an external capture program, here is an example command-line using the built in PPM frame capture support, using ffmpeg to generate a video:

{{{
logstalgia --output-ppm-stream ppm.out
C:\\ffmpeg\\bin\\ffmpeg -y -b 3000K -r 60 -f image2pipe -vcodec ppm -i ppm.out -vcodec libx264 -fpre "C:\\ffmpeg\\presets\\libx264-slow.ffpreset" -threads 0 logstalgia.x264.avi
}}}

*Note*: You may need to adjust the command line to point to where you installed ffmpeg, including the `-fpre` path to libx264-slow.ffpreset.
 
You can get `ffmpeg` build for Windows [http://ffmpeg.arrozcru.org/ here]. Guide to [http://rob.opendot.cl/index.php/useful-stuff/ffmpeg-x264-encoding-guide/ ffmpeg x264 encoding].
